# Enshu3: 1-month research projectsã€€@ UTokyo

Enshu3 ([Research Seminar of Information Science](https://www.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/vu/vu_lesson_entry.php?eid=00038&when=4)) is a mandatory course of the Dept. of Information Science, the University of Tokyo. One of the big purposes of this course is to let students get used to research activities. Within 3 months, we students endeavor to carry out small 3 research projects (1 project/month). One gives a presentation summarizing previous works, and another conducts experiments to raise/answer research questions, as many researchers do.

My research project are as follows:

- [Term1: Quantized Neural Network](https://github.com/Sharkkii/Enshu3/tree/master/Term1)
- [Term2: Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://github.com/Sharkkii/Enshu3/tree/master/Term2)
- [Term3: Evolutionary Alogirithm, Genetic Programming, AutoML](https://github.com/Sharkkii/Enshu3/tree/master/Term3)

Only program files (used in Enshu3 research projects) are available.
